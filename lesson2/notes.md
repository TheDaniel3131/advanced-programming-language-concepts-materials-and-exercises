# Lesson 2

Function: it is a mathematical function that is represented as f(X) = Y. X is argument and Y is output.

Pure Function: it is a function uses only its arguments as inputs, without access to global variables or external factors.  No side effects. No global variables as it Exhibits referential transparency ensuring same input yields the same output.

Referntial Transparency allows replacing an expression with its value without altering the result.
