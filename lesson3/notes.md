# Lesson 3

Recaps from this week tutorial:
1. Purity and Higher Order Function (Mostly in Java/JavaScript):
   - Side effets in functional programmming
   - Purity concept
   - Lambda basics
   - Higher order function
   - Map, Filter, and Reduce functions (JavaScript) [They are pure functions and HOF!]
  
## Immutability in Functional Programming (FP)
- Variables are immutable meaning they cannot change the values after define the variables through initialization.
- NOT possible to modify but we can create new variables, this helps to preserve the state.
- Only primitive values are immutable. Primitive datatypes such as String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbols.
- Always use 'const' instead of 'let'.
